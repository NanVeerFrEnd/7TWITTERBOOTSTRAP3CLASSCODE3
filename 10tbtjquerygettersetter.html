                <p> <b>The Magi Visit the Messiah</b><br>
1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem <br>
2 and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”<br>
3 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 When he had called together all the people’s chief<br>
priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. 5 “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for<br>
this is what the prophet has written:<br>
6 “‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br>
    are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br>
for out of you will come a ruler<br>
    who will shepherd my people Israel.’”<br>
7 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. 8 He sent them to Bethlehem<br>
and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”<br>
9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it<br>
stopped over the place where the child was. 10 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 11 On coming to the house, they saw<br>
the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with<br>
gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 12 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their<br>
country by another route.</p>
                <p> <b>The Escape to Egypt</b><br>
13 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother 
and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”<br>
14 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod.<br>
And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<br>
16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem <br>
and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. 17 Then what was said <br>
through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:<br>
18 “A voice is heard in Ramah,<br>
    weeping and great mourning,<br>
Rachel weeping for her children<br>
    and refusing to be comforted,<br>
    because they are no more.”<br></p>
                <p> <b>The Return to Nazareth</b><br>
19 After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 20 and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother <br>
and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”<br>
21 So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in <br>
Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, <br>
23 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazaren<br></p>
